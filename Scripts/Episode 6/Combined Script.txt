(kotones video clip from last episode)

Y - And then i was like, ew what the fuck, get your gross incel looking ass out of my face
you disgusting weirdo!

M - Nice one yukari, What a savage girl boss move! how dare these stinky low lifes think
they have the permission to even ask us on a date! 

A - I see.. So this is what i say to someone when they muster the courage to confess their love for me in a sincere way?

M - Oh absolutely Aigis! you have to make sure those guys never try that shit again! you give them an ounce of attention
    and they already think you want to marry them!

Y - Honestly, its so common to have some guy think you want to fuck them just because you asked them for a pen!

A - Understood! I will do a 'savage girl boss move' the next time this happens!

Y - Uhh mitsuru, what the fuck, theres 2 guys beating on your car!

M - Oh shit i see them! what has this town become! filthy criminals everywhere...
    the police cant do their fucking job properly!
    stay here you two i'll handle this!

M - FREEZE! Hands up! you fucking criminals! This gun is loaded and i know how to use it! Back away from the car NOW!

A - Woah Mitsuru what the fuck calm down! Its me and shinji! where did you even get that gun??!

M - Oh sorry, its only you two, wait hold on why the fuck are YOU two trying to break in my car?

S - Look long story short Kotone is in there and we need to drag her hoe ass out!

M - but I don't see anyone in there...

A - Come on How can you not see her shes right..., aw theres no fucking way she slipped away like that again!

S - Nice one mitsuru! you just had to distract us and cause a scene out of nothing didn't you?

M - Me? Causing the scene? How are you two blaming this on me? YOU WE'RE THE ONES FUCKING POUNDING
    ON MY CAR WINDOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET? 

A - MITSURU CALM DOWN WE DIDNT KNOW IT WAS YOUR CAR, Kotone ran away after we exposed her cheating ass and--

M - shut up! I dont fucking care about this little love triangle going on between you guys and Kotone! God you
    two are so lucky you looked japanese, i would of shot your asses on the spot!

S - Woah what the fuck? what are you trying to say here? If that we had a different skin colour you would of killed us?

M - Hey that is not what im saying! I just said that if you maybe had a darker complexion, I would of thought you were illegal immigrants 
    trying to steal my radio, then i would of been forced to shoot!

A - Holy shit.. you're fucking racist Mitsuru! 

M - I AM NOT RACIST! I am merely being cautious of the troubles these aliens bring to our country! do you think these scum
    that come to our great country with their shitty little boats, illegally by the way, are going to become upstanding working citizens? 
    Of course NOT!, they dont have any papers and or money, so they roam the streets stealing and pillaging from
    us, the hard working citizens of japan!

A - That is fucking racist you stupid bitch! not every person thats not japanese is going to be a fucking criminal!
    how long have you been cooped up in that mansion of yours? clearly you have no clue what actually goes on in the world! 
    Even if they come with no papers and money, theyre not here to cause trouble, but to find work and help support 
    their families!

S - Yea Mitsuru you racist bitch! A majority of these immigrants come here to find jobs! They're not fucking animals!
    These hard working people come and help with our labour shortage in Japan, we should be grateful for them!

M - Grateful? To them? Please don't make me laugh! Cologne, Germany, 2015 new year's eve, between the central railway station and the city's cathedral,
    there were widespread reports of theft and sexual assaults against women, the Perpetrators were of mainly Arab or North African appearance and 
    is speculated that they were recent immigrants or asylum seekers. Many women were left traumatised and there was widespread public outrage!
    This is the obvious result of carelessly allowing immigrants into a developed country! 
    These men are savages and dont know how to act! I have to carry a gun or i might end up a victim myself!

A - Ok what the fuck is she even saying right now

S - I have no fucking clue but didnt her voice change?

A - Oh yea i notice it too! Wait hold on mitsuru!

M - What is it? This is all true information by the way, you can check on google.

A - No not that! but your voice sounds different than it did before? have you not noticed?

M - I don't know what you mean I sound the exact same as i've always had...

S - No Akihiko is right I noticed it too! Huh, for some reason i thought your old voice was your original voice..

M - Ok just shut the fuck up! Are you trying to gaslight me Just because i ben shapiroed your asses with facts and knowledge?

S - What? that has nothing to do with this! 

Y - Holy fuck what are you guys still arguing about?

A - It seems that they are arguing over the fact that Mitsuru has racially motivated views, but Mitsuru next time please 
    bring me to the next armed confrontation, i am more than capable putting several holes in any criminal with my automatic weapons!

M - Yukari! Aigis! Didn't I say to stay there until i resolved this problem?

Y - Uhh mitsuru you've been gone for 5 minutes and i've just been watching you across the road argue with Akihiko and Shinji senpai about
    being a fucking racist!

M - Oh not you too! My bestie calling me racist too?

Y - Mitsuru look, i don't fucking care about you being racist, if everythings fine can we go home already i've been walking all day!

M - Ok ok, sorry I'll drive us home now

A - Wait hold on! 

M - What, you still want to continue the debate you're clearly losing?

A - firstly, you were the one losing, but no, can uhh, me and shinji get a ride too?

M - So let me get this straight, you're asking to bum a ride off me after banging on my car, denting my door, calling me a racist bitch
 and then started gaslighting me about my voice??

S - umm, yes? 

M - Ok, well I'll see you two at the dorm later, goodbye!

Y - Get fucked senpais! see ya!

Aigis - Goodbye you two! get fucked!

S + A - Those fucking whores-

A + M + Y - HAHAHA hahahaha

Y - so what was that all about?

M - Oh i dont know, something about Kotone cheating on them and then she was hiding in my car, but i honsetly wasnt listening i couldnt
    give two shits

Y - O M G Slay, those guys got what they deserved!

M - Oh you Yukari hehe,

Y - Trust me bestie, this shit is gas! I took one puff of it and it felt like my body literally left the earth! This will get
    you stoned for cheap!

M - Money isnt an issue here! The issue is that if i end up smoking that blunt and i start having a crack seizure, Im gonna
    lose control and drive us into another car!

A - Mitsuru there is no need to worry, I have already analysed this marijuana and it is indeed gas!

M - Well if Aigis says so... roll that blunt lets get this fucking rotation going!
