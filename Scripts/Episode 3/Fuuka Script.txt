Makoto how could you! Did our cooking sessions mean nothing to you? Especially that one
time after cooking you picked me up and pinned me on the -

Heyyyy! what do you mean by that Mitsuru?!

Oh sorry, I did actually tweak her software a bit, i might of forgot to update her system. 
But listen to this, Aygis is basically an alexa now! Hey Aygis!

What's the weather tomorrow?

I know right?! she can actually do a lot more if you want to try it out

In all honesty, i agree with Aygis, i'm actually fine with a polyamorous relationship, I trust our leader
will be able to give us enough time and affection for all of us as he as already been doing, 
and as long as makoto agrees to keep eating my food I have no issues!

see guys, this can work out!

Heyy that's really mean Yukari!

Yukari stop being a rude and stubborn bitch! I know you're just against it because of how much of a whore your Mum is!

Fuck you Yukari! you said you would never tell anyone about that! This is why everyone calls you a bitch, bitchkari!

Yea Mitsuru! you whore! didn't I hear you had sex with the teachers so you could become the
president of the student council!

All of you are such bullies! Why does everyone bring up my looks and my haircut, out of everyone here I'm the cutest one
and the most innocent, so you bitches have no chance against me if Makoto we're to choose who he would want to be with!
Whores! Whores! Whores! Whores! Whores! Whores! 

WHAT?!
