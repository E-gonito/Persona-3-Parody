Yea guys please carry on! i've got my popcorn ready!

i've been here the whole time, and you're right, this is even better than a K Drama!

Oh hell no... no offensive makoto but you're not my type, 

But i would usually go for literally anyone else, and especially young boys like ken~

Personally Mitsuru... I wouldn't take that, I mean they're all slandering you as a person and basically saying that 
you can't achieve anything in life without using your body.. But you do you i guess...

oooo good idea! 

everyone that's against the polyamorous relationship say eye!

well it's 3 against 2, so that means it's official, Makoto get's his harem yaaay!

oh classic sigma male makoto!

haaahaaahaaahahahahahahahahaha
