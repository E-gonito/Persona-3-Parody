Hey Mitsuru and Takeba, you wanna join us walking Koromaru to the shrine? Everyone else is already outside waiting.

Oh Thanks for the offer Akihiko, but me and Yukari here will wait here for Makoto to get back home.

Yea, we got a few things we need to discuss! so we wont be coming today...

Oh... uh... well good luck with whatever it is, we'll be back soon anyways. See ya 

Goodbye Akihiko, 

yea see ya

Yukari, just for one second, can you not act like a stuck up bitch?

Shut the fuck up I don't wan't to hear it. I'm tired having to act like nothing's wrong the whole day.
Especially with you!

Look. I don't enjoy this as much as you think. Everytime I look at you i want to take my hands
and crush your fucking skull, but you dont see me doing that.

You talk so much shit but i have never seen you take any actions on your words. But I think it'll
be best for both us to just shut up and wait for "him" to arrive.

Yes... I agree.

You hear that?

That overly loud emo music? yes i think he's gonna come through the door any second now...

What the fuck!? Makoto! Are you just gonna walk past without saying hello!?

I'm tired, check my status

You're Tired!? How the fuck does that make it ok to not even greet us!

Makoto! I think we need to have a long conversation before you're even allowed to leave this fucking room!

Ok... Before Yukari and I bring up what we wanted to discuss... Is there anything you wan't to get off your chest?
Considering that Me and Yukari are both here in this room!?!

No not really..

Nothing?

Naaa..

Ok Mitsuru, Before I clock this retard in the face, would you like to start the discussion.

Certainly Yukari, It has come to our attention that you have been engaged in a intimate relationship with the
both of us. Again, I wan't to be reasonable here and give you a chance to explain yourself, so I'll
ask again, do you have anything you want to say for yourself?!

I needed to max out your arcana social link's so i can fuse stronger personas

Are you shitting me? What the absolute fuck are you talking about, fusing personas?
were not in tartarus and this isnt a game you idiot!

Believe me, before we go to tartarus I to the velvet room through a door only I can see, then
A man with a long nose and bulging eyes takes my personas and fuses them for an even stronger one
according to the depth of my relationships. 

I'm not sure if i should be pissed or worried at that explanation!
What the fuck have you been smoking before you came in? Weed? DMT? Fentanyl? Crack? Meth?

Yukari please, I understand your fustration and not even I buy this shitty excuse of a justification, 
but let's hear him out one more time. Makoto, you're not fucking with us right now are you? because I'm seriously
losing my patience here, why are you going out with both me and Yukari at the same time!?

There's no option for a platonic route

Ok... Yukari he's fucking with us, get my sabre and a cross, i'm going to crucify this son of a bitch and hang him in front of
the dorm.

What a good idea Mitsuru! I'm glad we can finally come to terms on one thing, which is making sure this motherfucker
experiences the worst possible pain a human can experience!

Yes, as member's of Sees and victims of our leader's womanizing, we need to stick together if want to make sure this asshole is never able 
to touch his cock with his hands ever again

Oh speaking of cocks, i say we take turns with my bow, taking shots and see who can hit his dick first!

Oh Tres Bein Yukari, I didn't know you had that energy inside of you, I think we'll make a great team today.

Yea, I can really feel a strong bond between us...

...

...

Is this the Yuri event where you two start kissing in front of me

Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

Ok before we turn you into swiss cheese Makoto, i'm curious, If you had to choose between Me and Mitsuru who would you choose?

yes i'm also curious, just mind that whatever you say won't change our decision of turning you into the next crucified messiah on the streets

Aigis

Aigis?!
Aigis?!

You called?

What the fuck!?!
What the fuck?!?!

When did you arrive!

Well, when i heard my partner for life call out my name, i rushed back as fast as i could!
Did i mention that we have often get undressed and have initmate steamy robot se-

Aigis please shut the fuck up you bot i don't wan't to hear anymore!

Makoto how could you! Did our cooking sessions mean nothing to you? Especially that one
time after cooking you picked me up and pinned me on the -

Not you too Fuuka! please both of you slags shut the fuck up before i lose my mind!

Ok at this point i'm not even suprised you fucked a robot and fuuka

Shinjiro - Haha! stay here Ken! This is the funniest shit i've ever seen, funnier than when Mitsuru and Yukari was arguing over a 
stupid fucking cheesecake yesterday.

Junpei - Im with Shinji senpai! man! Watching hoes cat fight is the best thing ever!

Aki - Shinji! Junpei!... let's just give them their space, I have to admit this is definitely worth watching, even if it means 
missing some hours training for, but i dont wan't to be on the receiving end of Mitsuru's long, girthy, large steel sword

Thank you Akihiko, i'm not sure why you worded your last sentence like that... but please can the rest of you give us a girls a moment with Makoto.

Koromaru - Bark

Ken - ok then...

Shinjiro - Yea whatever

Junpei - Akihiko you're such a boner killer but Ok...

Akihiko - junpei don't make this sus, lets just leave.
