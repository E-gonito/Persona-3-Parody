Oh Thanks for the offer Akihiko, but me and Yukari here will wait here for Makoto to get back home.

Goodbye Akihiko, 

Yukari, just for one second, can you not act like a stuck up bitch?

Look. I don't enjoy this as much as you think. Everytime I look at you i want to take my hands
and crush your fucking skull, but you dont see me doing that.

Yes... I agree.

You hear that?

Makoto! I think we need to have a long conversation before you're even allowed to leave this fucking room!

Ok... Before Yukari and I bring up what we wanted to discuss... Is there anything you wan't to get off your chest?
Considering that Me and Yukari are both here in this room!?!

Certainly Yukari, It has come to our attention that you have been engaged in a intimate relationship with the
both of us. Again, I wan't to be reasonable here and give you a chance to explain yourself, so I'll
ask again, do you have anything you want to say for yourself?!

Yukari please, I understand your fustration and not even I buy this shitty excuse of a justification, 
but let's hear him out one more time. Makoto, you're not fucking with us right now are you? because I'm seriously
losing my patience here, why are you going out with both me and Yukari at the same time!?

Ok... Yukari he's fucking with us, get my sabre and a cross, i'm going to crucify this son of a bitch and hang him in front of
the dorm.

Yes, as member's of Sees and victims of our leader's womanizing, we need to stick together if want to make sure this asshole is never able 
to touch his cock with his hands ever again

Oh Tr√®s Bien Yukari, I didn't know you had that energy inside of you! I think we'll make a great team today.

Shut the fuck up!

yes i'm also curious, just mind that whatever you say won't change our decision of turning you into the next crucified messiah on the streets

Aigis?!

What the fuck?!?!

Ok at this point i'm not even suprised you fucked a robot and fuuka

But anwser me truthully, how many girls do you have a relationship with right now!

This truly has gotten out of hand

Thank you Akihiko, i'm not sure why you worded your last sentence like that... but please can the rest of you give us a girls a moment with Makoto.
