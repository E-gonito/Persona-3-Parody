Yea, we got a few things we need to discuss! so we won't be coming today...

Shut the fuck up I don't want to hear it. I'm tired of having to act like nothing's wrong the whole day.
Especially with you!

You talk so much shit but I have never seen you take any actions on your words. But I think it'll
be best for both of us to just shut up and wait for "him" to arrive.

That overly loud emo music? yes I think he's gonna come through the door any second now...

What the fuck!? Makoto! Are you just gonna walk past without saying hello!?

You're Tired!? How the fuck does that make it ok to not even greet us!

Ok Mitsuru... Before I clock this fucking retard in the face, would you like to start the discussion.

Are you shitting me?! What the absolute fuck are you talking about!?! fusing personas?!?!
We're not in Tartarus and this isn't a game you idiot!!

I'm not sure if I should be pissed or worried about that explanation!
What the fuck have you been smoking before you came in?! Weed?! DMT?! Fentanyl!? Crack!? Meth!?

What a good idea Mitsuru! I'm glad we can finally come to terms on one thing, which is making sure this motherfucker experiences the worst possible pain a human can imagine!

Oh speaking of cocks, I say we take turns with my bow, taking shots and see who can hit his dick first!

Yea, I can really feel a strong bond between us...

Shut the fuck up!

Aygis?!

When did you arrive?!

Aygis please shut the fuck up you sex bot, I don't want to hear any more from you!

Not you too Fuuka! please both of you slags please... shut the fuck up before I lose my mind!

Oh great now everyone's back...
