Hey Mitsuru and Takeba, you wanna join us walking Koromaru? Everyone else is already outside waiting.

Oh... uh... well good luck with whatever it is, we'll be back soon anyways. See ya 

I don't think that's how it works Junpei...

Shinji! Junpei!... let's just give them their space, I have to admit this is definitely entertaining to watch, even if it means 
missing some hours training, but i don't wan't to be on the receiving end of Mitsuru's long, and girthy, steel sword.

Junpei im gonna ignore that sus ass comment, lets just leave them be.
