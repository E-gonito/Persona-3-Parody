Hey Mitsuru and Takeba, you wanna join us walking Koromaru? Everyone else is already outside waiting.

Oh... uh... well good luck with whatever it is, we'll be back soon anyways. See ya 

I don't think that's how it works Junpei...

Shinji! Junpei!... let's just give them their space, I have to admit this is definitely worth watching, even if it means 
missing some hours training for, but i dont wan't to be on the receiving end of Mitsuru's long, girthy, large steel sword

Junpei don't make this sus, lets just leave.
