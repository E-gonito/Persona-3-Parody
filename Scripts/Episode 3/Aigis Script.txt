You called?

Well, when i heard my partner for life call out my name... i rushed back as fast as i could!
Did i mention that we have often get undressed and have steamy robot sex?

eHe 

Oh Koromaru you're so funny, Makoto is really fucked isn't he?

Before we start engaging in a drawn out argument with each other filled with jealousy, slut shaming and unnecessary digs, 
can i suggest a solution to everything? Why don't we all agree to a polyamorous relationship with my husband- i mean Makoto?

Yes, Fuuka?

Tomorrow's weather is expected to be partly cloudy with a high of 75 degrees Fahrenheit and a low of 58 degrees. 
There is a 20% chance of rain.

Well from my analysis, we can offset those drawbacks by having open and honest communication about each other's
needs, we're all close team members here so it shouldn't be an issue considering all that we've already been through.

How about this then! everyone that agrees with my idea stays in a relationship with Makoto, and the rest of you bitches 
can stay out of our business! Then everyone's Happy!

Bitchkari!

I also recall that information as well
