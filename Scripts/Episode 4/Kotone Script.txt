oh! hey there! 

You must be Ken2012 from Genshin Impact right?

yep thats me! im so happy you remembered my name!

oh sorry! i cant! my eyes are allergic to the sun! its a rare genetic disease
that only affect 0.46% of the population.

sike! i was just joking! wow you really believed me?

oh thanks for the compliment Ken! im glad you came here today!
so where are these cupcakes you promised me?

No you guys got it all wrong! I was just possessed by a shadow!
I was only just now able to escape its control 
by removing the glasses!

Well it looks like you guys have it all under control! thanks again
for saving me from the shadow, but i need to go now, see you all later!

Wait everyone behind you!
is that the naked lovers shadow with B J written on their nipples! 

and a Furious Gigas shadow with huge muscles and a massive crotch bulge!
