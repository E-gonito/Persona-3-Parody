Hey Mitsuru and Takeba... you wanna join us walking Koromaru to the shrine? Everyone else is already outside waiting.

Well, good luck with whatever it is... we'll be back soon anyways. See ya 

I don't think that's how it works Junpei...

Shinji! Junpei!... let's just give them their space, I have to admit this is definitely entertaining to watch, even if it means 
missing some hours training, but i don't want to be on the receiving end of Mitsuru's long, and girthy, steel sword.

What! the! absolute fuck!
